This is towards my Computer Science A-Level Project. 
I have been inspired by games like Celeste and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.
I have watched DaFluffyPotato for pygame tutorials. He is a legend.
Here are my Success Criteria:

1.)BASIC PHYSICS
The game will start production as a single, simple level that has working collisions and gravity. 
Instead of animated characters, I will use Pygame rectangles of roughly the right shape and size to test and build these features. 
The whole level will just be some simple blocks and platforms for testing purposes. 

2.)BASIC MOTION AND MOVING PLATFORMS
The character will be able to jump and has the capability for special kinds of motion with certain blocks (different coloured rectangles). 
For example, there will be wall-jumping, swings and climbable regions. 
There will also be blocks added for the puzzle/ platformer element of the game, such as moving platforms, springs and collapsing road.

3.)LEVEL EDITOR AND SCROLLING TILEMAP
The game has a level editor built in, with scrolling and and a tile-based map included. 
For now, this is a program separate from the game.

4.)MULTIPLE LEVELS
The game has an element of progression introduced, with multiple, increasingly difficult levels that scroll left-right up and down, with a camera focusing on the player. 
The level editor will be used to design the maps and place start and end points. 
The levels have a transition from one to the next.

5.)BASIC ENEMIES
Basic enemies with a periodic motion are added to the game as red rectangles. 
Their attacks are purely melee/ collision-based.

6.)LIVES, HP AND BANNERS
The player has HP and a HP bar to show this. 
This health is whittled down by enemy attacks. 
The player also has an undecided number of lives, which are lost by falling off of the map or losing all HP. 
Lives are represented by a banner in the top-left corner of the screen. 
Losing all lives results in resetting the level.

7.)GRAPHICS OVERHAUL
There is a huge graphics overhaul, to give the proper retro medieval feel to the game. 
This allows for a visually stimulating appeal to be introduced. 
Enemies will become King John’s guards and the hero will become Bobbin Dud. 
Rectangles thus removed.

8.)SETTING OVERHAUL
Parallax scrolling, off-grid components and new backgrounds add to the graphics overhaul by fully fleshing out the settings or each level. 
This will be changed in the level editor. 
New features will include trees, clouds, bushes and villages.

9.)ATTACKS FOR BOBBIN DUD
The user is given a range of options for attack:
  - Ranged: Bow and arrow
  - Melee: Sword-fighting

10.)STEALING FROM THE RICH...
Points are awarded for defeating enemies in the form of coins. 
There are more coins given for more difficult to defeat enemies. 
There is also a coin banner at the top of the screen.

11.)ANIMATION
Animation is added, giving indicators when powers are in use and attacks are underway.

12.)MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS
There are bonus ways to unlock power-ups. 
For example, giving money to the poor during levels rolls random chances of different rewards.

13.)THE OLDE SHOPPE
A shop (run by a character not dissimilar to friar Tuck) will appear at the end of each level, offering power-ups in exchange for coins earned throughout the levels. 
The player will be able to buy armour, strength and speed boosts.

14.)NEW, INTELLIGENT ENEMIES
New enemies will be added. 
These will be more complex, bigger and more intelligent enemies that will  act as the bosses/most difficult foes in the game. 
There will be a heuristics-operated King who fights Bobbin Dud, as well as proximity-activated knights on horseback.

15.)ACCOUNTS AND LEADERBOARDS
Accounts will be added to track progress throughout the game and store it in a local file. 
This will then be translated into leaderboards for comparison with other players on statistics such as: level reached, jumps completed, fewest deaths, speed of completion. 
This will be a graphical user interface.

16.)GUI OVERHAUL
The game has a new start screen; with the game’s title and options for playing, the level editor, leaderboards and account access. 
There is use of the sword/shield/bow iconography, and the level editor is now  an integrated feature of the game.

17.)TUTORIALS
Tutorials will teach the player how  to play the game their first time round. 
This involves a side character such as an animal or another Merry Man holding up a sign. 
This will become passive or optional within a menu after the first time played.

18.)PARTICLES AND SCREENSHAKE
Particles appear around the player on spawn/movement/attack/death. 
These will make the motions of the game much more realistic. 
Screenshake is added for this purpose as well.

19.)… GIVING TO THE POOR
There are bonus ways to unlock power-ups. 
For example, giving money to the poor during levels rolls random chances of different rewards.
